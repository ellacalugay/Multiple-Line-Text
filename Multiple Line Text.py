# Writing a method in python that writes multiple line of text contents into another text file.

# Pseudocode
# Open a file "mylife.txt" in write mode.
# Create a while loop with a True condition.
# Inside the loop, ask the user to input a line of text.
    # Write the entered line into the file using the write() function.
    # Ask the user if they want to enter another line of input.
        # Check if the user wants to continue.
            # exit the loop and continue executing the code
        # Check if the user wants to stop.
            # exit the loop and stop the execution of the code
        # If the user enters an invalid input, prompt them to enter a valid one.
    # Check if the user wants to stop again (in case they entered 'y' in the previous loop).
            # exit the outer loop and stop the execution of the code
# End of the code.
